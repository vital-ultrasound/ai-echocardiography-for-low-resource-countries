Importing arquitectures in [FourChDetection_worker.py](../FourChDetection_worker.py)
``` 
import fcd_utils.classifiers as classifiers
from source.models.architectures import basicVGG2D_04layers, SqueezeNet_source0

Feel free to try other arquitectures in [source/models/architectures.py](../../../../models/architectures.py) by importing them.
